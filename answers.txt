What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge allows you to merge two separate branches together into one. 
A rebase puts the changes of one branch onto another. This changes
the history of the branch, unlike the merge. 

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your coding project that is 
stored onlnie rather than locally. However, you and other people can
still have local version of the project to work on and then push
the changes you made onto the remote repository.
